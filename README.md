# Jison Atom package  
Adds syntax highlighting to Jison files in Atom.  
  
Thanks to, and based in part on the following projects:  
1. [Bison improved plugin](https://github.com/EliaGeretto/language-bison-improved)  
2. [Bison plugin](https://github.com/toroidal-code/language-bison)  
3. [Lex/Flex plugin](https://github.com/maemre/language-lex-flex)  
 
To Do:  
1. Jison technically allows inline %lex ... /lex sections. Support these.  
2. Rules can be defined across multiple lines in Jison. Support this (currently breaks on, e.g., "TOKEN \\n\\t : RULE DEF;")  

Contributions are greatly appreciated.  
Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, work on to-dos (above), etc. Thx!
