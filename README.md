# Jison Atom package
Adds syntax highlighting to Jison files in Atom. A tweaked version of the [Bison plugin](https://github.com/toroidal-code/language-bison), which itself was originally [converted](https://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle) from the [Bison TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/bison.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
