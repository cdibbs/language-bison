# Jison Atom package
Adds syntax highlighting to Jison files in Atom.

Thanks to, and based in part on the following projects:
1. [https://github.com/EliaGeretto/language-bison-improved](Bison improved plugin)
2. [https://github.com/toroidal-code/language-bison](Bison plugin)
3. [https://github.com/maemre/language-lex-flex](Lex/Flex plugin)

To Do:
1. Jison technically allows inline %lex ... /lex sections. Support these.
2. Rules can be defined across multiple lines in Jison. Support this (currently breaks on, e.g., "TOKEN \\n\\t : RULE DEF;")

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, work on to-dos (above), etc. Thx!
